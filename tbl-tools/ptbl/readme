Table printing README - MS 93
-----------------------------

This program is good for snooping through table file to see what
they contain. You will almost always want to use the "-a" option.

The ptbl program will print a type table in 2 forms:

 1. By default tables are printed in ASN.1 value notation for the
    TBL ASN.1 data structure (See the tbl.asn1 file in snacc/asn1specs).

 2. Using the "-a" option makes ptbl print the type in the type table in
    ASN.1 form.  Some parts are not printed - IMPORT/EXPORT info
    (although you could figure it out).  The ASN.1 printing code
    (in pasn1.c) is very simple and is a good way to become familiar
    with the TBL data structure (type tables).


Type "make" to build ptbl.
Type ./ptbl to see the arguments it expects.

try:

./ptbl -a ../demo-tbls/p-rec.tt

also try:

./ptbl ../demo-tbls/p-rec.tt

ptbl without the -a option is only really useful for debugging.
